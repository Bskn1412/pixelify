        <P>
          A few things are stored <em>locally, by your browser, on your device</em>. We never
          receive them; they exist only as your browser's site data. You can delete all of it at
          any time via your browser's "clear site data" control for this site, which resets
          Pixelify to a first-visit state.

              <strong>Model cache (Cache Storage).</strong> Neural model files you have used
              (roughly 2–67 MB for the upscaler, ~40 MB for the background remover) are cached so
              they do not re-download on every visit. These are stock model weights, not data
              about you.

              <strong>Images, session only.</strong> Your images live in memory for as long as the
              tab is open. Closing or refreshing the tab discards them. Nothing is written to
              persistent storage; a legacy local history feature existed in earlier versions and
              has been removed and actively deleted on load.

      <Section id="network" num={4} title="Network requests the site makes">
        <P>
          Honesty requires listing these, because "runs locally" describes your images, not the
          ordinary requests a browser makes to load any website. Pixelify makes the following
          requests, none of which carry your images or any personal data:

        <UL
          items={[
            <>
              <strong>The site itself.</strong> The application files are served by our hosting
              provider, GitHub Pages. Like every web server, GitHub receives standard request logs
              (IP address, user agent, time, page requested) for delivering the site. See the
              <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.
            </>,
            <>
              <strong>Model files.</strong> Upscaler models are fetched from the same domain as the
              site and then cached by your browser. The background remover's Chopper model is
              downloaded through Transformers.js from the
              <a href="https://huggingface.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Hugging Face</a> model hub. It is a one-time ~40 MB file that is then cached. These requests contain a URL and nothing about your images.
            </>,
            <>
              <strong>Open-source libraries.</strong> ONNX Runtime Web (the inference engine) and
              its WebAssembly binaries are loaded from
              <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> jsDelivr</a>, a public content-delivery network. jsDelivr serves the library file; it never sees your images.
            </>,
            <>
              <strong>Fonts.</strong> Typefaces are served by Google Fonts. Google receives the
              standard request data involved in serving a font (IP address, user agent). If you
              prefer to block it entirely, the site remains fully usable with system fonts.
            </>,

        />
        <P>
          That is the complete list. If you block all of the above with a firewall or a content
          blocker, the only consequences are cosmetic (system fonts) or functional (models will not
          load, so the tools cannot run). None of them are privacy-related.

          Summarised: <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> (hosting), <strong>Hugging Face</strong>

          <strong> Google Fonts</strong> (typefaces). Each processes the limited request data
          described above under its own privacy policy; we have no commercial relationship with
          them that involves your content, and we do not send them anything beyond ordinary asset
          requests.

      <Section id="rights" num={6} title="Your rights & choices">
        <P>
          Because we hold no personal data, there is no stored profile to access, correct, export
          or delete on our side; the usual data-subject requests have nothing to attach to. The
          data that exists about your usage lives in your browser, under your control:

          If you are in a jurisdiction with statutory data rights (GDPR, CCPA and similar), you
          hold all of them; to the extent any apply, note that the exercise cost to us is zero,

        <P>
          Pixelify collects no data from anyone, including children, and is not directed at children
          under 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction). Since there is no account system
          and no data collection, no parental consent mechanism exists or is required.

          If this policy ever changes, for example if a future feature involves a server, the
          updated version will be published on this page with a revised date at the top, and any
          change that alters what leaves your device will be called out on the products page and
          the blog before it takes effect. We do not notify users individually because we have no
